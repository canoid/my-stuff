<p> in this (WIP) web I want to register my  drawing path from scratch so, for that I'm gonna stablish and follow the next rules:
<ol>
	<i> draw every single day, could be anything,from anatomy to the weird idea of the day </i>
	<i>study and practice anatomy at least 4 times per week</i>
	<i>draw from reality as much as possible </i>
	<i> and at the last but not less important:<strong>HAVE FUN!</strong>
</ol>
